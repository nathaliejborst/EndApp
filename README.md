App let's user make an account which is connected to Firebase. After logging in or creating an account, the user can create a personal group and add users already registered to the app. The user can find already registered useres by searching by e-mail. Susbequently the user can add others to be  a member of their group. After choosing a groupname (groupnames don't have to be unique), groupcolor and adding group members, the he/she can create the group. Within a group member can add tasks. When adding a task a startdate and frequency/repetition (daily, weekly or monthly)  is required. The app provides a personal calendar in which the logged in user can see it's own tasks. A marker is visible for every task in the calendar. Every task marker has the chosen groupcolor so the overview is a little easier. When clicking on a day the user sees it's tasks for that day and when clicking on the task also the groupname of which the task is from. Within a group tasknames should be unique.
